# CRM Integration

Simply put, CRM integration is building your website and CRM to function together seamlessly. Instead of using your CRM to just be a system that retains customer information based on manual entries, CRM integration promotes your CRM to work double-time, automatically bringing in valuable customer lead data directly into your CRM using information already found on your website!

Aside from the benefits mentioned above, CRM integration with your website helps streamline the sales process as leads come in through your site. Fields such as name, company, e-mail and phone are typical areas that will be populated from your site to your CRM, and in most cases, you'll be able to pinpoint when the lead visited your site, what they looked at, where else they visited and what information they requested - all viewable in a single area! Other custom fields are usually welcome in integration, depending on the needs of your company.

Better yet, with some CRMs, you can choose advanced options, so if a customer submits information from a particular part of the country, a representative from your company will be automatically funneled that information, without any other steps in between!
